# [WEB PROJECT]

I came across a random webpage on the internet that caught my eye — I really liked the design and flow. So, I decided to recreate it entirely on my own using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

Everything you see here is built from scratch based on that inspiration — no templates or copied code. Just observed, understood and developed my own version.

## 🔧 What’s Inside

- **home.html** – Page structure
- **home.css** – All custom styles
- **script.js** – Adds interactivity
- **images**    – Visual elements used in the page

## ⚙️ Tech Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 💻 How to Run

1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Open `(https://voluble-cheesecake-0ad964.netlify.app/)` in any browser.
3. That’s it — explore the design and functionality.
